# OrbitSim-Python

# About
OrbitSim-Python is a simple Python project that simulates the motion of a planet in orbit around a star. 

The project provides a basic simulation of the physical principles governing the motion of a planet in orbit, including the gravitational force exerted by the star on the planet and the resulting acceleration of the planet. 

The user can adjust various parameters of the simulation, such as the mass of the star and the initial position and velocity of the planet, to see how these factors affect the planet's orbit. 

The project is intended to be a fun and educational tool for learning about the basics of planetary motion.
